# Gene-disease-network-analysis
This project analyzes shared genetic mechanisms among Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and Hypertension using network science and graph-based machine learning. Centrality analysis and Node2Vec-based clustering reveal latent genetic similarities across metabolic disorders.
## Data
The dataset is provided as zipped folders:
- Obesity.zip
- Hypertension.zip
- Type2Diabetes.zip

Each archive contains gene–disease association files used for network construction.  
Please unzip the folders before running the notebook and ensure the folder names match the paths used in the code.
